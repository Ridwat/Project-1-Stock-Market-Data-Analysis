Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Cleaning, Merging, and Visualization
📌 Project Overview

This repository contains my full analysis of the Daily Historical Stock Prices (1970–2018) dataset as part of a data analytics and AI coursework project.
The goal is to understand how stock prices, market volatility, and trading activity have evolved across five decades: 1970s, 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s.

The project includes:Data loading & extraction from a ZIP archive

Cleaning and preprocessing of 20M+ rows

Merging stock metadata with price data

Creating decade segments for macro-level comparison

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Summary statistics, distribution plots, time-series charts, and boxplots

A written technical report summarizing findings & hypotheses
Key Findings

Stock prices rose significantly across decades.

Trading volume increased sharply, peaking in the 2000s.

Volatility became much higher in the 1990s–2000s.

Later decades show more extreme outliers and larger price swings.
